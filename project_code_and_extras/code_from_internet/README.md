The notebooks here (in this subfolder called code_from_internet) were not produced by the student. 

These notebooks were downloaded from the following links:

- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DIQm9rOx2mT1bZETEeVUThxcrP1RKqAn  (CS224W code example)
- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EMgPuFaD-xpboG_ZwZcytnlOlr39rakd  (MNIST_Superpixel_GCN)
- https://avandekleut.github.io/vae/                                         (avandekleut_vae)

I (the student) just wanted to make it clear that these notebooks were used as inspiration and that I copied various snippets from these sources, but later heavily modified the code according to the needs of my project.
