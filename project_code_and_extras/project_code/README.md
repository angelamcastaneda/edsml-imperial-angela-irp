All the project's code is contained in this folder. 
This project aimed to create the best possible AutoEncoder design for a certain dataset. 

The functons of the project are located in the subfolder "auxiliary_scripts".  

The other subfolders contain different jupyter notebooks that use the functions of the project to test different models of AutoEncoders. To do so, certain STEPS were followed and each STEP is summarized in a subfolder of this folder. It is possible to understand each STEP by entering each subfolder and reading its own README file.

The STEPS order is as follows:

- STEP 1: test_activation_functions
- STEP 2: small_datasets_results
- STEP 3: wavesuite_dataset_results
